edb is a cross platform AArch32/x86/x86-64 debugger. It was inspired by [Ollydbg](http://www.ollydbg.de/ "Ollydbg"),
but aims to function on AArch32, x86, and x86-64 as well as multiple OS's. Linux is the
only officially supported platform at the moment, but FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OSX and
Windows ports are underway with varying degrees of functionality.

edb is available under the GPL 2 license, see the COPYING for details.

NOTE: This README now only covers the most essential documentation, for more
complete documentation see the [wiki](https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger/wiki)


Cloning
-------

When cloning the repo, please use git's `--recursive` flag to ensure that the
sub-modules will be properly cloned and updated to the correct versions.
Here is an example:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger.git`

Compiling
---------

Compiling edb is generally quite simple. edb currently depends on the
following packages:

Dependency                                  | Version Required
------------------------------------------- | ----------------
[Qt](http://www.qt.io/)                     | >= 5.6
[Boost](http://boost.org) (Headers Only)    | >= 1.35
[Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) | >= 3.0
[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)        | >= 2.38.0 (Optional)

Many distributions already have packages that satisify these. The wiki contains
examples for some popular distributions:

* https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger/wiki/Compiling-(Fedora)
* https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger/wiki/Compiling-(Ubuntu)
* https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger/wiki/Compiling-(Debian)

Once you have the necessary dependencies installed, compilation is done with
`cmake`:

### CMake

If you plan to just run edb out of the build directory, it's as simple as this:

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	$ ./edb

If you would like to properly install edb on the system for all users, it's
only a little different:

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ ..
	$ make
	$ make install
	$ edb

Installing
----------

Basic installation is simple, you may run

	$ make install

In which case the plugins will be installed in `/usr/local/lib/edb` and the
binaries will be installed in `/usr/local/bin/`.
